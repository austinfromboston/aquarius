Aquarius is the core datastore for a distributed CRM which is accessed by accounting, time-tracking, client portal and lead-generating applications.

The Aquarius data network is an attempt at a "small pieces, loosely coupled" architecture for small business.  It uses CAS for a common authentication framework and cross-domain ajax to post data between the participating applications.
